Here's an overview of the project based on the files you provided:

1. Training Process Overview:
The model training process uses CNN layers to detect plant diseases. You have used TensorFlow and Keras APIs for model development.
The dataset was likely preprocessed to suit the CNN model's input structure, and training included multiple epochs to optimize the model's performance on classifying plant diseases.
Training history shows significant improvements in both accuracy and loss values across epochs:
Accuracy started at 60.7% and improved to 95.7%.
Validation Accuracy increased from 84.2% to 96.3%, indicating strong generalization on unseen data.
Loss values dropped from 1.32 to 0.13, and the validation loss dropped from 0.50 to 0.11, indicating that the model learned the patterns in the data effectively while avoiding overfitting​(training_hist).
2. Key Metrics:
Final Accuracy: The model achieved a final accuracy of 95.7% on the training set, which is quite impressive for a deep learning model.
Final Validation Accuracy: The final validation accuracy of 96.3% suggests that the model generalizes well on new data, implying it can be highly reliable in real-world use cases.
Loss Reduction: The reduction in loss, both for training and validation, demonstrates that the model learned well from the data while avoiding major overfitting issues​(training_hist).
3. Possible Techniques Used:
CNN Architecture: The core model likely consists of a series of convolutional layers followed by activation functions (e.g., ReLU), pooling layers, and finally fully connected layers for classification.
Regularization: Since the model avoids overfitting, techniques like dropout, batch normalization, or early stopping might have been used.
Data Augmentation: Given the complex nature of plant disease data, you may have used data augmentation (rotations, scaling, flipping, etc.) to improve model robustness.
Streamlit Integration: Based on earlier discussions, you might have integrated this model into a Streamlit application to provide an interactive GUI for users to upload images of plants and receive predictions in real time .
